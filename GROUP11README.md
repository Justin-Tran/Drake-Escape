Also developed the powerpoint for our presentation.

How to Play:
- Hold touch left or right of the character to move in that particular direction
- Tap screen again while moving to jump (can double jump)
- Tap anywhere on the bottom 25% (ground platform) of the screen to shoot a projectile. 
  You only have one so you must pick it up to use it again.
  The projectile is only active until it hits the first enemy. To make it active again, you must pick it up.
- Avoid touching randomly spawning paparazzi or twitter birds, doing so will make you lose a life
- Moving off the screen will teleport you to the other side
- Falling in the hole will teleport you to the top
