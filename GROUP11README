How to Play:
- Hold touch left or right of the character to move in that particular direction
- Tap screen again while moving to jump (can double jump)
- Double-tap to shoot a projectile. You only have one so you must pick it up to use it again.
- Avoid touching randomly spawning paparazzi, doing so will make you lose a life

- Falling in the hole will teleport you to the top
